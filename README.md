## Project Description

I would like to create an application that used a React front end and a Python/Django/PostgreSQL backend. This application is for vehicle services at maintence repair shops. This application is intended to be used by the employee to easily identify a customer , and add them into the database.


## API

Use this section to include info about the API you have chosen and a code snippet of the data that it returns and is required for your project. 



## Wireframes

Upload images of wireframe to cloudinary and add the link here with a description of the specific wireframe. Also, define the the React components and the architectural design of your app.

## Components
##### Writing out your components and its descriptions isn't a required part of the proposal but can be helpful.

Based on the initial logic defined in the previous sections try and breakdown the logic further into stateless/stateful components. 

| Component | Description | 
| --- | :---: |  


Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Also, put a gif at the top of your Readme before you pitch, and you'll get a panda prize.

| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invetsted | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Research | MVP| 6 hrs |  | |
| Building Components | MVP | 4 hrs |	| 	|
| Deployment | MVP | 8 hrs? | | |
| Working with RestAPI | MVP | 4 hrs|  |  |
|Additional Styling | postMVP | 4hrs | 	| |
| Total | H | |  |  |

## Additional Libraries

Would be using Reactstrap and Bootstrap for React front end
